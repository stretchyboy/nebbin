# Nebbin!

Going and looking at the things that gave Sheffield's areas their names.

[Place names in England are weird](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/inspire-me/origins-of-english-place-names/)
, especially in Yorkshire where Viking 
influences add to the mix of French, Brithonic, Latin and Anglo-Saxon.

So why Stannington called Stannington and is there a thing that Beaucheif 
is named after.

We will be exploring Sheffield and trying to find out.
